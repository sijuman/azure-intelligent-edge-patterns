# Deploy a Highly Available MongoDB Solution
## About this sample
### Overview
This sample will step you through an automated deployment of a basic
highly available (HA) MongoDB cluster with a disaster recovery (DR) site
across two Azure Stack environments. To learn more about MongoDB and
high availability, go
[here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/).

You’ll learn how to:

  - Orchestrate a deployment across two Azure Stacks
  - Use Docker to minimize dependency issues with Azure API Profiles
  - Deploy a basic highly available MongoDB cluster with a disaster
    recovery site

## How to run this sample
### Prerequisites

  - Two (2) connected Azure Stack Integrated Systems (Azure Stack), this
    deployment does not work on Azure Stack Development Kits (ASDKs). To
    learn more about Azure Stack, go
    [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/).
      - A tenant subscription on each Azure Stack.    
      - **Make a note of each subscription ID and the ARM endpoint for
        each Azure Stack.**
  - An Azure Active Directory (AAD) service principal that has
    permissions to the tenant subscription on each Azure Stack. You may
    need to create two service principals if the Azure Stacks are
    deployed against different AAD tenants. To learn how to create a
    service principal for Azure Stack, go
    [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-create-service-principals).    
      - **Make a note of each service principal’s application ID, client
        secret, and tenant name (xxxxx.onmicrosoft.com).**
  - Ubuntu 16.04 syndicated to each Azure Stack’s Marketplace. To learn
    more about marketplace syndication, go
    [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item).
  - [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
    installed on your local machine.

### Get the Docker Image

Docker images for each deployment eliminate dependency issues between
different versions of Azure PowerShell.
1.  Make sure that Docker for Windows is using Windows containers.
2.  Run the following in an elevated command prompt to get the Docker
    container with the deployment scripts.
```powershell
docker pull intelligentedge/mongodb-hadr:1.0.0
```
### Deploy the Clusters

1.  Once the container image has been successfully pulled, start the
    image.
```powershell
 docker run -it intelligentedge/mongodb-hadr:1.0.0 powershell
``` 

2.  Once the container has started, you will be given an elevated
    PowerShell terminal in the container. Change directories to get to
    the deployment script.
```powershell
cd .\MongoHADRDemo\
```

3.  Run the deployment. Provide credentials and resource names where
    needed. HA refers to the Azure Stack where the HA cluster will be
    deployed, and DR to the Azure Stack where the DR cluster will be
    deployed.

```powershell
.\Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.ps1 `
-AzureStackApplicationId_HA “applicationIDforHAServicePrincipal” `
-AzureStackApplicationSercet_HA “clientSecretforHAServicePrincipal” `
-AADTenantName_HA “hatenantname.onmicrosoft.com” `
-AzureStackResourceGroup_HA “haresourcegroupname” `
-AzureStackArmEndpoint_HA “https://management.haazurestack.com” `
-AzureStackSubscriptionId_HA “haSubscriptionId” `
-AzureStackApplicationId_DR “applicationIDforDRServicePrincipal” `
-AzureStackApplicationSercet_DR “ClientSecretforDRServicePrincipal” `
-AADTenantName_DR “drtenantname.onmicrosoft.com” `
-AzureStackResourceGroup_DR “drresourcegroupname” `
-AzureStackArmEndpoint_DR “https://management.drazurestack.com” `
-AzureStackSubscriptionId_DR “drSubscriptionId”
```

4.  Type “Y” to allow the NuGet provider to be installed, which will
    kick off the API Profile “2018-03-01-hybrid” modules to be
    installed.

5.  The HA resources will deploy first. Monitor the deployment and wait
    for it to complete. Once you have the message stating that the HA
    deployment is complete, you can check the HA Azure Stack’s portal to
    see the resources deployed. 

6.  Continue with the deployment of DR resources and decide if you’d
    like to enable a jump box on the DR Azure Stack to interact with the
    cluster.

7.  Wait for DR resource deployment to complete.

8.  Once DR resource deployment has completed, exit the container.
```
exit
```

### Next Steps

  - If you enabled the jump box VM on the DR Azure Stack, you can
    connect via SSH and interact with the MongoDB cluster by installing
    the mongo CLI. To learn more about interacting with MongoDB, see
    [The mongo Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/).
